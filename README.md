# shop_app

* Shop App: I started to apply in this project what I learned from the course (flutter clean architecture) by Eng/ Usama elgendy.
* Some of the things I learned from this experience are writing clean code and applying the principles of design patterns.
* App Features:
...Clean architecture.
...Get_it (Service Locator).
...Bloc(cubit).
...Rest API.
...Shared Preference.
...TypeAhead (for auto-complete search).
...Animation.
